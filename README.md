## Brief background
EDEX comes to solve real problem. We work in startup Yorso.com. The problem is suppliers and customers from different countries use paper documents to exchange. This process takes minimum 3 days and more. Also it costs quite a lot. So we decided to create better way to organize business.


## How is innovative and ambitious
We took the DocuSign project and role model. We decided to use blockchain to eliminate human factor (noone can change data after transaction is commited), also it allows to make the process of signing transparent. During analysis of competitors, we found that project VisaBot is loved by user (the main communication channel is chat-bot). So we used chat bot as main communication interface.
According to market research, TAM of the market is 6 billion dollars. SAM is 2 billions. We expect we grab at least 6 millions stake.
